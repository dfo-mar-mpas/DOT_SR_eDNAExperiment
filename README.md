# Evaluating an Autonomous eDNA Sampler for Marine Environmental Monitoring: Short- and Long-Term Applications

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/777918323.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13126692)

Code and data for an environmental DNA (eDNA) experiment conducted in summer 2023 comparing [DOT autonomous eDNA samplers](https://dartmouthocean.com/products/edna-sampler) with a standardized protocol using Smith-Root benchtop filtering setup. 

Sample processing and sequence data is provided through a partnership with the Hakai Institute, British Columbia. Raw sequence reads are available in the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1139183)

__Fig 3.__ Comparison of species richness by sampling method and sample time. Dashed lines represent the average number of shared species and the total number of species detected among sampling methods at each time point. Error bars indicate standard error.

__Fig 4.__ Comparison of species richness trajectories by sampling method and eDNA marker. Ribbon plots represent species accumulation curves, while points indicate the Chao extrapolated richness in the sampled species pool (Â± s.e.) for each sampling method over the sampling period.

__Fig 5.__ Plot comparing compositional changes in species richness as a function of sampling period, amplification primer, and community dissimilarity metric using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Size of points corresponds to the sampling period scaling from smallest (week 1) to largest (week 9).
